# util
Utility scripts for working with datasets for machine learning:

1. split_train_test.py: small script to split a multinomial directory dataset into train and val. Full recursion is provided. Set the desired split ratio directly within the script (change 0.2 to whatever is desired). Place script into dir with subdirectories, and run:  python3 split_train_test.py

Starting dir structure should be as follows:

dataset_dir
  
  --subdir1
  
  --subdir2
 
  split_train_test.py
 

Script will create
  
  dataset_dir
  
   --subdir1
   
   --subdir2
   
   --....
   
   --val
    
    ---subdir1
    
    ---subdir2
    
  split_train_test.py
